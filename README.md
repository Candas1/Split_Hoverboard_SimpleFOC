## this is just the beginning.. 
HallSensor class working and three led blinking while rotating the (slave) wheel.

### This PlatformIO code is based on https://github.com/Candas1/Sideboard-Arduino from Candas1

### for choosing your hardware layout look here: https://github.com/RoboDurden/Hoverboard-Firmware-Hack-Gen2.x

### You have to choose the GD32F103C8 or GD32F103C6 enviroment, otherwise the code will hang at startup

### Big thanks to https://github.com/CommunityGD32Cores/ArduinoCore-GD32 for making it possible to build a firmware based on https://github.com/simplefoc
